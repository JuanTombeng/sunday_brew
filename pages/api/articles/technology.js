            "article_description": "One of the best ways for software engineers to keep up to date with trends in the field is to attend conferences. And after a couple of years of virtual conferences and even canceled events, many organizations will be back in 2022 to holding in-person gatherings, and others are opting for hybrid events. Attending these conferences will allow you to hear keynotes from world-class practitioners and learn from tech talks with leading authorities. You'll also have the opportunity to participate in informative Q&A sessions, as well as engage with peers who can help answer your questions. In addition, you'll acquire actionable ideas that you can bring back to your team and implement immediately.",

            "article_description": "Such stimulants have long been useful for understanding touch, the most complex of all human senses. In the 1990s, studies of capsaicin, an extract of chilli peppers, and menthol, found in peppermint, helped us pin down how our bodies react to hot and cold conditions. Now, Jasmine Lu and her colleagues at the University of Chicago are using this knowledge to create chemically induced sensations, to make virtual environments astonishingly realistic. In a technology dubbed chemical haptics, they have built a wearable device that, when placed on the skin, can cause the wearer to experience a range of sensations – hot or cold, numb or tingly – on demand. Its uses could include creating intensely realistic virtual worlds for gamers to explore or for training firefighters.",

            "article_description": "The MIT AI Hardware Program is a new academia and industry collaboration aimed at defining and developing translational technologies in hardware and software for the AI and quantum age. A collaboration between the MIT School of Engineering and MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, involving the Microsystems Technologies Laboratories and programs and units in the college, the cross-disciplinary effort aims to innovate technologies that will deliver enhanced energy efficiency systems for cloud and edge computing. “A sharp focus on AI hardware manufacturing, research, and design is critical to meet the demands of the world’s evolving devices, architectures, and systems,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering and Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Knowledge-sharing between industry and academia is imperative to the future of high-performance computing.” Based on use-inspired research involving materials, devices, circuits, algorithms, and software, the MIT AI Hardware Program convenes researchers from MIT and industry to facilitate the transition of fundamental knowledge to real-world technological solutions. The program spans materials and devices, as well as architecture and algorithms enabling energy-efficient and sustainable high-performance computing.",

            "article_description": "A post-it note with the question “What is a full-stack developer” written on it has been sitting on my desk for a few weeks. At first, I didn’t know how to approach the question. I wanted to develop an answer that made sense to anyone new to the arena of web development, but that still touched upon the finer details. After all, maybe you are someone interested in making a career change and have repeatedly seen the words “full-stack web developer” on every technical educational website and job application. In this post, I’m going to be giving you both the wider scope and some of the details of what this sought-after job entails and my experiences within the field. Hopefully by then, that should answer that sticky-note question for both novices and more experienced coders alike. Essentially, we’re going to learn what is a full-stack developer, and how you can become one.",

            "article_description": "A useful way of illustrating the difference between a web developer and a web designer, is framing the comparison through something we all know. So, I want you to imagine a web developer and a web designer getting together to build a car. A web developer would be responsible for using various components like the engine, transmission, wheels, etc. to construct a fully-functional car that is error-free in its technical aspects. A web designer would be responsible for the aesthetic design of the car (the comfort of the seats, the layout of the dashboard, etc.) as well as the convenience in driving and riding in the car. Makes sense, right?Just as ostriches and zebras travel together in nature to survive, web developers and designers have a symbiotic relationship in working together to create an amazing product. In this article, I’ll outline these two career choices in an article that you can read as you enjoy a cup of coffee. I must admit, I went down the web development route with CareerFoundry and it was an amazing experience that laid a solid foundation for me. I built a portfolio website and an e-commerce site from scratch—I didn’t know anything about coding or web development before I started. I enjoyed their course structure, community of mentors and students, and experience so much that I am also looking to go through their web design program. However, I wasn’t paid to recommend CareerFoundry and this isn’t an endorsement hiding in the disguise of an article for their program—I strongly recommend doing your own research before making a decision.",
