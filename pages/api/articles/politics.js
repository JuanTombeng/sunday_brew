            "article_description": "Russia appears to be retaliating for the sinking of its flagship missile cruiser Moskva, which Ukrainian forces say they hit with missiles, as explosions are heard in Kyiv. The loss of such a major naval asset may force Russia to rethink its strategy in the Black Sea, analysts say. Finland’s minister for European affairs says the Nordic country is “highly likely” to join NATO, a move Russia has warned against. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden says what took place in the Ukrainian town of Bucha was “indisputable evidence of Putin’s war crimes everywhere. Ukraine’s defense ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said on Friday that for, the first time since the start of its invasion, Russia used long-range bombers to attack the besieged port city of Mariupol. Motuzyanyk said Russia was concentrating its efforts on seizing the cities of Rubizhne, Popasna and Mariupol.",

            "article_description": "J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives from the bank contributed to the campaign of centrist Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has opposed key pieces of her party’s and President Joe Biden’s agenda, during the first quarter. Dimon, according to Sinema’s latest Federal Election Commission filing, donated $2,900 to the lawmaker’s political operation in February. That amount is the most an individual can give directly to a candidate’s campaign. Records indicate that Dimon gave to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the last quarter, which spanned from January to March 31. The senator, who has received support from executives and corporate political action committees since pushing back on her own party, is up for re-election in 2024. Arizona is considered a swing state despite having two Democrats representing it in the U.S. Senate. [Sen. Mark Kelly is vying for re-election this year.] The state also went for Biden in the 2020 election, the first time since 1996 that a Democrat won Arizona. Sinema has opposed certain pieces of Biden’s agenda, including the idea of raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. She supports the proposed 15% minimum corporate tax on declared income of large corporations, meanwhile. Many financiers within Sinema’s own party have already been plotting a primary against her. The donations from Dimon and the other J.P. Morgan executives came after Sinema reiterated in January that she would not support proposed changes to the Senate’s filibuster rule. Mary Erdoes, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management line of business, gave $2,900 to Sinema’s campaign in February. Robert Baynard, a vice chairman at the bank, gave $2,000 to her campaign in late January.",

            "article_description": "WASHINGTON — German authorities said they have seized the world’s largest superyacht following official confirmation that the vessel had links to Russian billionaire and business tycoon Alisher Usmanov. A German official confirmed to CNBC on Thursday that the motor yacht was linked to Usmanov and therefore subject to asset seizure. Germany’s federal police informed European authorities in Brussels on Wednesday that a thorough investigation found the vessel was owned by Usmanov’s sister, Gulbakhor Ismailova. The stunning superyacht was initially restricted from leaving its anchorage by German authorities on March 3, according to a senior Biden administration official with knowledge of the matter. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the yacht had not been physically seized at the time but rather was not allowed to move from its current location in the German port city of Hamburg. The person had added that more measures would be taken later. The yacht, named Dilbar after Usmanov’s mother, extends over 500 feet and is equipped with two helipads and the largest indoor swimming pool ever installed on a private vessel. The Department of Treasury estimates that the current value of Usmanov’s yacht is approximately $735 million. Usmanov and his superyacht entered the crosshairs of the U.S. and its allies in March following coordinated global sanctions on Russian elites with Kremlin ties after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. A Treasury official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said any action taken by German authorities would not involve transferring the vessel to the United States under Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, sanctions.",

            "article_title": "Ukraine seizes 26 cars and 32 apartments of detained Kremlin ally Medvedchuk",
            "article_description": "WASHINGTON -- Authorities in Ukraine announced Thursday that they have seized more than 150 assets belonging to Viktor Medvedchuk, the former media mogul and politician who is charged with treason for allegedly conspiring with the Kremlin to overthrow Ukraine’s elected government. They included 26 cars, 32 apartments, 23 houses, 30 plots of land, 17 parking spots and a yacht, according to an announcement from Ukraine’s security service. Authorities said they also identified and seized shares of capital in 25 companies owned by either Medvedchuk or his wife, Oksana Marchenko. Medvedchuk was detained this week by Ukrainian law enforcement after more than month as a fugitive, after he escaped from house arrest in the chaos following Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Reputed to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest Ukrainian friend, news of Medvedchuk’s arrest on Tuesday was greeted with jubilation in Ukraine, which is holding out against a brutal Russian assault. On Thursday, Ukraine’s top law enforcement officer for the first time offered details of the mission to recapture Medvedchuk. He said Russian agents planned to smuggle Medvedchuk out of Ukrainian territory by boat into the Russian-occupied region of the country, and from there on to Moscow. When Medvedchuk was captured, the 67-year-old was wearing a Ukrainian army uniform and accompanied by what appeared to be real Ukrainian law enforcement officers. The photo of Medvedchuk in custody that was released by Ukrainian authorities this week offers no hint of his enormous wealth, estimated by Forbes Ukraine to be just over $620 million in 2021. But the asset seizures tell a different story, painting a clear picture of the lavish lifestyle of one of Ukraine’s richest oligarchs. Medvedchuk owned several palatial homes across Ukraine. His house outside of Kyiv features a real Pullman train car with a gold interior, parked at a fake station platform. Earlier this year, a judge in Ukraine ordered that three apartments, two villas and a yacht all belonging to Marchenko be seized. The 300 foot-long Royal Romance is valued at approximately $200 million, and it was docked in Croatia when it was repossessed in mid-March. Ukrainian authorities did not provide any details on Thursday about the second yacht they had seized.",

            "article_title": "Biden to nominate Michael Barr as Fed bank regulator in second attempt to fill post",
            "article_description": "President Joe Biden will nominate Michael Barr, a former Treasury Department official, to be the Federal Reserve’s top regulator in charge of big banks. The choice of Barr was expected after CNBC earlier in the week confirmed that he was the White House’s frontrunner for the post. It would make the leading financial laws author perhaps the most powerful U.S. bank regulator: the Fed vice chair of supervision. Barr served as assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions during the Obama administration, where he helped design the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. That law was one of the most expansive overhauls of financial regulation in U.S. history and came on the heels of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Among its many provisions aimed at protecting the economy from future calamity, Dodd-Frank produced both the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Fed’s vice chair for supervision. “He was instrumental in the passage of Dodd-Frank, to ensure a future financial crisis would not create devastating economic hardship for working families,” Biden said in a statement Friday morning accompanying the formal White House announcement. “He understands that this job is not a partisan one, but one that plays a critical role in regulating our nation’s financial institutions to ensure Americans are treated fairly and to protect the stability of our economy,” Biden added. The president also underscored the fact that Barr received support from both Democrats and Republicans when he was previously confirmed by the Senate. That may be an oblique acknowledgement of the difficulties the administration has faced in trying to advance some of its nominees for financial regulatory posts in a Senate split 50-50.",
